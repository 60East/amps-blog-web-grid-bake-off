This is the repo with the artifacts for the original blog article [Grids Without Gridlock: Which is Fastest?](http://www.crankuptheamps.com//blog/posts/2017/10/05/grid-comparison/)


# Overview

This repository contains sample demo projects that demonstrate how to use
[AMPS](http://www.crankuptheamps.com/) with different web grid components, such as:

- [ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) -- including its React and Angular components
- [SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki)
- [OpenFin's HyperGrid](https://openfin.co/hypergrid/)
- [Webix DataTable](https://webix.com/widget/datatable/)
- [PrimeNG](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/datatable)

Each grid demo is located in the corresponding directory. Each demo project
contains a README file with further details and instructions on how to use them.

The `tools` directory contains the graph building script that was used for visualizing
comparison data, as well as a simple publishing Python script.
